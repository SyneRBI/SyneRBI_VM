## Installation
Check the [README](https://github.com/SyneRBI/SyneRBI_VM/blob/master/vagrant/README.md) in vagrant.

## What this is

This project will create a Ubuntu 18.04 box with docker preinstalled and a 
GUI manager. It also installs docker and docker-compose so that the 
SIRF docker image can be created and run from within the VirtualBox VM.
